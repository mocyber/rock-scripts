== A collection of Bro scripts

This is a collection of bro scripts that do some unique things. To use,
go to your `site` directory and check it out to a named item.

[source,bash]
----
cd /opt/bro/share/bro/site
git clone https://github.com/mocyber/bro-scripts.git rock
----

Then, in your `local.zeek` add the following at the bottom:

[source,bro]
----
# Load the cyberdev scripts
@load rock
----

This loads all the scripts defined in `__load__.zeek`. If there's a script
that you'd like to use that is not in there, you can load it directly:

[source,bro]
----
# Load JSON util function
@load rock/utils/json
----

== TODO

- [ ] Cleanup scripts and add common header
- [ ] Create skeleton script file as a starter
